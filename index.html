        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!--This needs changing but I like the vibe :)-->
        <p>I'm a PhD student at the UCL High Energy Physics Group.
            My supervisor is Dr Sarah Malik and I'm researching how
            quantum computers could be used by particle physicists.
            I grew up in Poland and moved to the UK to pursue higher education.
            Each year I grow more fascinated by physics, maths and science.
            I'm super greatful for the privilige to discover their secrets
            as a career.
        </p>
        <p>
            I studied for an integrated Masters degree in Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology
            at Lancaster University. I started my degree being mostly busy dealing with moving
            to a different country by myself. After a year or so it clicked that I have a real 
            chance to become a scientist, which had previously never really occurred to me,
            not having much exposure to the world of research back home.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was drawn to abstract and mathsy stuff, first becoming fascinated by the science
            of fundamental particles and quantum mechanics, then the cosmos on the large scale.
            Then I learned about quantum computation. I was introduced to programming, and that was
            awesome, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Science can be quite obscure. It's boring and confusing to people who aren't 
            naturally drawn to it. Weirdly, even when presented by professionals to
            other professionals, the meaning can get lost in technical jargon.
            This website is partially an exercise in science communication.
