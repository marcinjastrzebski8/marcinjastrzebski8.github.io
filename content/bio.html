            <p>
                Developing quantum machine learning algorithms to tackle the most computatonally-heavy aspects of analysis in high energy physics.

                Riverlane is a company solving the problem of quantum error correction.
                I worked on open problems in well-known quantum error correction experiments.

            </div>

            <p>
                Helping deliver outreach particle physics masterclasses and teaching first years (coding and basic lab practices) and fourth years (advanced computing techniques).
            </p>

            <h3>Internship at Lancaster University Summer 2020 </h3>
            <div class="icon">

            </div>
            <p>
                Worked with Elmer (finite element software) to perform initial simulations for an experiment designed to detect axions (potential candidate for dark matter).
                It pretty much involved simulating a microwave!
                
            </p>

            <h3>Physics Ambassador 2019-2021</h3>

                <img src="../icons/persons-in-a-class-svgrepo-com.svg" alt="Icon">
            </div>

            <p>
                Helped deliver varous outreach events, from particle physics masterclasses for A-level students to building periscopes with 7-year-olds.
                I also helped with running the National Astronomy Meeting in 2019.
            </p>

            <h3>Undergrad at Lancaster University 2017-2021</h3>

            <div class="icon">

            </div>

            <p>
                Specialised in particle physics and cosmology.
                To make my living I had to work part-time for up to 30hrs a week rolling burritos and serving drinks in a bar.
                That wasn't very fun. I'm having much more fun now, though!
            </p>

            <h3>High school in Turek, Poland 2014-2017</h3>

            <p>
                Did my matura (A-level equivalent) in my humble hometown's high school I LO Turek (general-education high shcool number one of Turek).
                At this point had no clue I'd ever become a scientist, I just liked physics and maths.
